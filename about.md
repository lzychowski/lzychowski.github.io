I am a problem solver, seasoned full stack engineer, and a leader with experience ranging from graphic design all the way to project management. Over the last 14 years I have explored every nook and cranny of the software development world. The best part is that there is always more to learn. 
 
I have experienced the power of cloud computing, JavaScript, Node.js, TypeScript, Java, Ruby, C#, C++, C, VB, Perl, Lisp, Assembly, 3D modeling, SQL, NoSQL, and many more. Combine that with devops experience, teaching, architecture, agile development, and management and you get a recipe for success.

### Application Development Manager / Lead Front-End Engineer
***
**Omeda Communications, previously Hallmark Data Systems, Northbrook, IL**  
*11/2015 – Present*

There are some projects that developers are scared of.  This can be due to the lack of documentation, high complexity, or mix and match of technologies that make it hard to understand.  I found myself to be the go to person for reverse engineering projects like this.  From extremely abstract JavaScript and C# frameworks to outdated authentication modules, I am the person that can figure them out.

This is all in addition to my day to day responsibilities which include UI design, coding in JavaScript/TypeScript, building front-end frameworks using Angular1&2, creating C# or Java APIs, and managing multitude of development projects.

My second priority is to oversee and take part in the IT migration from Hallmark Data Systems to Omeda Communications due to an acquisition.  This includes migration of C# and Java production applications, fulfillment data, application servers, SAN infrastructures, and legacy mainframes.

On average I spend 75% of my time coding, architecting, and designing and 25% of my time managing teams and projects.


### Front-End Development Team Lead
***
**Hallmark Data Systems, Skokie, IL**  
*08/2014 – 11/2015*

I was a manager to a team of front-end designers and developers and an interim development manager to a team of back-end developers. In addition to employee management tasks I spent majority of my time researching, architecting, and implementing C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript solutions.

I trained my teams daily on topics of front-end and back-end architecture as well as how to successfully operate in a multi-team agile development environment.
As a team lead I worked closely with stakeholders, business owners, mid-level management, database team members, quality assurance team members, as well as the lead architect in order to facilitate the development of Hallmark’s internal systems.

On average I spent 80% of my time coding, architecting, and designing and 20% of my time managing teams and projects.

### Senior Front-End Web Developer
***
**Hallmark Data Systems, Skokie, IL**  
*06/2013 – 08/2014*

As a senior developer I was overseeing all of the front-end design and development taking place at Hallmark.  My primary responsibility was the creation and maintenance of complex JavaScript frameworks across multiple projects.  In addition to that I researched, prototyped, and documented various front-end technologies and standards.
Part of my day to day activities included working with product owners and project managers in an agile environment.  I played a big role in a successful adoption of agile methodologies at Hallmark. I also created acceptance criteria and user stories while managing the on time delivery of features.


### UI Designer
***
**Hallmark Data Systems, Skokie, IL**  
*02/2012 – 06/2013*

My main objective for this position was to apply my current design and front-end development experience to help Hallmark take over a project from an outside vendor, Reach Creative.  I have worked with Reach for about 6 months while this transition was in progress.  I began with UI design and acted as the QA/QC for all of the work delivered by Reach.  After the transition was over I became the main front-end developer for this and several other projects.

During my time as the UI Designer I have successfully standardized Hallmark's front-end web applications by implementing Marionette.js and Backbone.js frameworks on top of the existing JavaScript codebase.

### ISP Analyst / Junior Front-End Developer
***
**Hallmark Data Systems, Skokie, IL**  
*01/2009 – 02/2012*

As an ISP Analyst in addition to Email Specialist responsibilities (see previous position) I was tasked with research in topics of email deliverability, subscriber list hygiene, and email marketing.  I worked closely with our clients, domain admins, anti-spam organizations, and ISPs to help our clients with email deliverability best practices.

I designed and built various reports based on my findings.  The technology I used was a combination of PERL/SQL/JavaScript and various charting libraries.  The data sources included internal email system databases, client’s external sources, and MTA logs.

Over time my duties grew to include UX and UI design as well as QA tasks for Hallmark's upcoming email system.

### Email Creative Designer
***
**Hallmark Data Systems, Skokie, IL**  
*01/2007 – 01/2009*

I began working at Hallmark as an Email Creative Designer, a position that put me in charge of Stormpost email system and IronPort MTAs.  My responsibilities included managing a web based email system, scheduling email blasts, maintaining subscriber lists, designing email creative, and training clients (on site and off site).

Design services ranged from full email design to troubleshooting rendering issues across different email clients.  In spare time I researched email marketing techniques in order to provide our clients with the best possible ESP service.

### President and Insurance Producer
***
**Xterra Financial Services, Wood Dale, IL**  
*01/2006 – 01/2007*

Xterra was a family business my sister and I opened in 2006.  As the president I was responsible for the maintenance of business and insurance licenses, contracts, and day to day business operations.  I was a notary public and I was licensed by the State of Illinois to be able to produce Casualty and Fire insurance.

My other responsibilities were the design of marketing materials for Xterra and maintenance of office technology.

### Freelance Graphic and Web Designer / PC Technician
***
**Self-Employed, Wood Dale, IL**  
*08/2002 – 01/2007*

I started working on websites and computer graphics during my sophomore year in St. Patrick High School. By the end of the year I was the unofficial webmaster for the school and was responsible for most of the school’s design work.

Throughout these years I worked on variety of print, web, and marketing designs for individuals, non-profits, and companies in the Chicagoland area.  I used variety of technologies including Adobe Flash, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Premiere.

My secondary focus was building computers, troubleshooting hardware and software, and setting up small scale home and office networks.
